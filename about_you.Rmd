## Why are you taking Statistics?  
Did you take Math 115 or Math 116 ?  Did you know Math 115 only satisfies a general education requirement but that Math 116 counts as taking statistics in several transfer institutions??  
What grade do you need to attain in stats to not upset your future plans, What is your plan?  
 

### my answer     
  
   I did take math 115 but I didn't do well that year. I did know that math 115 did for GED but I didn't know Math 116 had more importance for other institutions. At least a B and higher is better.
